# Previous
<!--- TODO: Fill in -->


# TODO/BUGS(?):
- clear_storage for counters
- clear_* method tests
- hook AR reload method to clear_storage?
- add a way (maybe using MR) to expire keys in Riak
- Riak exists doesn't check expiry
- Remove backend methods that are not required
- Remove pry
- When deleting objects on the Riak backend, also delete the expiry
- Now, counters always have their expiry reset
